Blast your way to the top of the leaderboard in Retrogue! This retro-inspired top-down shooter challenges you to destroy enemies, gain points, and level up. At each level, you choose from one of three random upgrades for yourself, but be careful - you also have to choose an upgrade for your enemies! Can you outshoot and outsmart your foes to claim the top spot?

This game was made over 5 days for the [$5000 Ultimate Mini Game Challenge By BIGA](https://itch.io/jam/biga-ultimate-mini-game-challange) game jam.
